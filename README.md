# ðŸŽ‚ Birthday Paradox Monte Carlo Simulator

A **Flutter Web App** that uses a **Monte Carlo simulation** to estimate the probability that two people in a group share the same birthday â€” also known as the *birthday paradox*.

## ðŸ§  About the Project
This project demonstrates how **Monte Carlo methods** can be used to estimate probabilities through random simulations.  
The app lets users:
- Adjust the number of people in the group (2â€“100)
- Run thousands of random trials
- See the estimated probability of a shared birthday

## ðŸ“Š Monte Carlo Algorithm
1. Randomly assign birthdays (0â€“364) to `n` people.
2. Check if any two share the same day.
3. Repeat for many trials.
4. Estimate the probability as:
